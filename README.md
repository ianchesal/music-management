# Music Management Tools

This is a collection of things I use to manage my media. I collect a lot of
live shows and find working with all the files via the command line much
easier.

Note: None of these will work out of the box for you. They contain hard-coded
paths and server names that are specific to my environment. But they'll work
well as a place for you to start.

# Additional Requirements

You'll want to have the following things installed locally through whatever means you use to manage local installations:

* [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
* [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)

# See Also

* [My dotfiles](https://github.com/ianchesal/dotfiles) -- lots of interesting stuff there
